# restaurantapp
This is an application dedicated for restaurant management

Client : I wish an app which can allowed my employee to get orders. 
It must contain the whole dishes and drink of the restaurant.
It will be also an administrator screen to modify, delete and add elements.
The pads which take order are offline, and they have to connect to a server which will process the order send by the pads. At every time during the service and at the client demand, the order can be modified.
When the client ask for the bill, the order of his table is send to the guichet. The order canâ€™t be modified anymore.
